- __Strategy__ - _"The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them
  interchangeable.
  Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it."_
  
- __Observer__ - _"The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects
  so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are updated automatically."_
  
- __State__ - _"The State Pattern allows an object to alter its behaviour when its internal state changes.
  The object will appear to change its class."_
